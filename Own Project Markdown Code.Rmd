# Introduction

## Motivation and goals

Labor informality is a serious problem for several underdeveloped countries, one of them being Bolivia, where according to the latest data it would exceed 80% of total employment. Informality is considered negative for an economy because behind it are hidden elements such as the precariousness of work, low salaries, risks of accidents and labor exploitation, absence of health insurance or retirement, to mention just a few.

For this reason, it is fundamental for the country's authorities and economic and social policy makers to understand what are the main factors behind people's decision to enter the labor market but as informal workers. The academic literature on the subject indicates that characteristics such as education, labor and retirement legislation, minimum wage rules, and other intrinsic factors such as the customs or traditions of each population are the most important in explaining labor informality.

It is along these lines that my project focuses on developing models studied within the Platform (edX) courses that can serve to classify between formal and informal workers using a series of demographic and labor variables for Bolivian workers. My interest goes a bit beyond simple classification, I also want to know what are the main variables that explain the results behind each of the models and thus be able to know with some certainty what are the factors that should be taken into account when designing economic or social policies that seek to reduce labor informality in my country.

## A glimpse about labor informality

The International Labor Organization (ILO) --*main agency of United Nations for setting labour standards, developing policies and devise programmes promoting decent work for all women and men* --- states that the term "informal economy" refers to a certain way of carrying out economic activities. The informal economy comprises more than half of the global labour force and more than 90 per cent of micro and small enterprises worldwide. Informality is an important characteristic of labour markets in the world with millions of economic units operating and hundreds of millions of workers pursuing their livelihoods in conditions of informality.

The expression "informal economy" encompasses a huge diversity of situations and phenomena, as mentioned before. Indeed, the informal economy manifests itself in a variety of forms across and within economies. In this sense, formalization processes and measures aiming to facilitate transitions to formality need to be tailored to specific circumstances faced by different countries and categories of economic units or workers.

The main characteristics of work in the informal economy are often characterized by small or undefined work places, unsafe and unhealthy working conditions, low levels of skills and productivity, low or irregular incomes, long working hours and lack of access to information, markets, finance, training and technology. Whats more, most of the workers in the informal economy are not recognized, registered, regulated or protected under labour legislation and social protection.

Studies have identified that some of the main causes for informality include elements related to the economic context, the legal, regulatory and policy frameworks and to some micro level determinants such as low level of education, discrimination, poverty and lack of access to economic resources, to property, to financial and other business services and to markets. The high incidence of the informal economy is a major challenge for the rights of workers and decent working conditions and has a negative impact on enterprises, public revenues, government's scope of action, soundness of institutions and fair competition.

The promotion of decent work needs a comprehensive and integrated strategy and involves a range of institutional and society actors that eliminates the negative aspects of informality, while preserving the significant job creation and income generation potential of the informal economy. It should promote the protection and incorporation of workers and economic units in the informal economy into the mainstream economy using a good understanding of the main factors that cause it in each country.

## About the data: Household Survey for Bolivia 2018

For this project I will be using data from the Household Survey for Bolivia 2018, this information is freely accessible through the website of the National Institute of Statistics: (<https://www.ine.gob.bo/index.php/censos-y-banco-de-datos/censos/bases-de-datos-encuestas-sociales/>). The Household Survey is an instrument which aims to provide statistics and socio-economic and demographic indicators of the Bolivian population, necessary for the formulation, evaluation, monitoring of policies and design of action programs for the country development.

The 2018 Household Survey has the following specific objectives: 1. Produce a database with updated information on important variables that will generate statistics and sector indicators for monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). 2. To measure the behavior of poverty indicators of the Bolivian population according to their determinants. 3. Identify the demographic and socioeconomic conditions of the population with work or employment activity, their household income, poverty, housing quality, health care and education.

The Household Survey 2018 presents a complete picture of the living conditions of the Bolivian population. The unit of analysis for this survey was Bolivian households and it is a cross-sectional survey. The thematic scope of the survey covers the following eight aspects:

a)  Characteristics of the Housing
b)  Socio-demographic characteristics
c)  Migration
d)  Characteristics in Health
e)  Educational Features. Access and Use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)
f)  Activity Condition and Occupational Characteristics
g)  Non-labor household income
h)  Household expenses

For the purpose of this project, I will use the measurement of employment, unemployment and underemployment indicators, calculation of poverty indicators, calculation of access indicators and years of schooling, and calculation of other demographic indicators for the construction of the models that will allow us to forecast labor informality.

## Document structure

The rest of the document is structured in the following way, an Analysis section where in a first part I explain the process of data cleaning, imputation of missing observations and partition of the base into a training base and a testing base, then I explain the development of three different models of machine learning to make forecasts of labor informality. In the Results section I present the main findings of my three models explaining the main characteristics of each one. Finally, I conclude my project by summarizing the mos important results for my models, explaining the limitations of my work and the future ideas to be developed.

# Analysis

Figure 1 shows some of the demographic and labor characteristics of Bolivian workers that would be accompanied by high levels of labor informality. For example, we observe that very high levels of informality[^1] among workers who do not receive remuneration, those who work in agricultural activities in rural areas, or those self-employed workers who work in small companies (with less than 5 workers), are also accompanied by high levels of informality among workers in commerce, construction or transportation, as well as those who identify themselves as indigenous.

[^1]: A worker is considered to be informal if he or she does not make social security contributions or is not affiliated with a Pension Fund Administrator, in other words, informality is approached through those workers who do not contribute for their retirement.

![Percentage of informal workers according to different criteria](Plots/Rplot1.png "Percentage of informal workers according to different criteria")

Figure 2 we can see other characteristics of numerical variables (hours worked per week, monthly labor income and length of time in the job), in which we see that informal workers tend to work on average almost 1.5 hours more per week than formal workers, earning approximately \$305 per month, or only 48% of what a formal employee earns, and finally, we see that informal workers have stayed on average 1 year longer in their current job when compared to formal workers, which may show less labor dynamism in this sector.

## Data wrangling & descriptive elements

For this project I take 15 demographic and labor market variables from the Bolivian Household Survey for 2018. These 15 variables have been selected taking into account that they can be good predictors of labor informality observed in the country. Among the selected demographic variables are: 1. the zone (urban or rural), 2. gender (male or female), 3. age, 4. race (whether the interviewee is considered indigenous or not), 5. number of household members, 6. interviewee's years of education and 7. If the interviewee is considered poor according to the household income criteria.

In the case of the labour market variables included in our study we have the following: 8. economically active population (persons 15 years of age or older), 9. labor category (distinguishing between employees, employers, self-employed and unpaid), 10. branch of labor activity (with 9 categories: agriculture, mining, manufacturing, basic services, construction, trade, transportation, financial institutions and social services), 11. size of the company (small, medium and large), 12. labor formality (our independent variables that take the value 0 for informal and 1 for formal), 13. working hours per week, 14. monthly labor income (measured in local currency), and 15. length of time in the job (measured in years).

We can see here the summary of our raw data base:

```{r structure of the raw data, echo=FALSE}
summary(mydata)
```

The initial raw data base presents data for 37,517 people; however, in a first stage we will filter the data to keep only those people who are considered economically active, that is, those who are 15 years old or older, remaining after this operation with 17,659 observations.

In a next stage we look for extreme values in the variables so that once identified we can isolate them in order to avoid disturbance of these few observations in the models we are going to develop. To perform this process, we use Tukey's rule presented in the course, which states that the extreme values will be those that exceed the values located at the 75th percentile of the distribution plus 1.5 the interquartile range (IQR), see [@irizarry2019introduction] for more details.

**Outliers.** We also identified extreme values in four of the numerical variables in our database (age, hours of work, labor income and seniority), on the other hand, we did not find evidence of outliers in the variable years of education. The total of extreme values found is 2,878, these observations were filtered from the database to avoid potential biases in the subsequent projections.

**Missing values.** Once the outliers were eliminated, we concentrated on working with the missing values, identifying the absence of 562 data in 3 variables of our base: size of the companies, years of education and poverty. For this project I decided to impute the missing values using the BagImpute function of the Caret package[^2] instead of eliminating the observations with missing data, this for two reasons, the first to practice with the use of this important data imputation tool and the second, to not continue losing data, since with the cleaning of outliers I lost almost 3,000 observations.

[^2]: This method of recovering missing values uses bagging of regression trees. It provides the recovery of missing values for several variables at once, based on regression dependencies. For more information you can consult the Help repository for Pre-Processing of Predictor on the Caret package.

The first step for the imputation of the missing values was to convert the character variables into factors, and then to be able to convert all the variables into dummies, this because the BagImpute function only allows to make imputations for numerical variables. Once the imputation was done, the only thing left to do was to work a little with the new predicted variables (education, firm size and poverty) to return them to the original values of the initial base and thus begin with the construction of the forecast models for labor informality.

**Data partition.** Once the new imputed variables (new education, new poverty and new firm size) were added to the data, I proceeded with he partitioning of the database into the training and testing sub-samples following the criteria of maintaining the balance of the variable of interest (in this case labor formality), that is, we know that the original base presents a proportion of about 80% of informal workers and 20% of formal workers, for this reason, it is of utmost importance to maintain these proportions in the sub-samples that we will create and use for both the training and the validation of our models.

My database, after the cleaning of extreme values and the imputation of missing values has been left with 17,734 observations. We can see that in this final base, 3,046 people are formal workers and the remaining 11,688 are informal workers, that is, the informality rate is 79.3%.

Using this rate as a reference, I proceed to create a partition of this database into a training set and a test set. My new training base is composed of 11,786 observations and the testing base of 2,948, as you can see below, both sub-samples maintain the proportion of approximately 80% informal and 20% formal workers:

```{r ratios new test and train sets}
prop.table(table(train_set$formality))

prop.table(table(test_set$formality))
```

With databases properly sorted, cleaned and partitioned, we are ready to begin our model analysis to forecast labor informality in Bolivia.

## Data modeling approaches

Since our variable of interest for our models is labor informality, a dichotomous variable (0, 1), it is appropriate to choose methodologies suitable for this type of variable. In this sense, one of the best known methodologies in conventional econometrics for dealing with dichotomous dependent variables is that of logistic regression, with which I will begin my analysis. Later, I will advance with new methodologies learned in the different modules of the course, taking advantage of the greater computational power of methodologies such as classification trees, and I will finish with the approach of a random forest.

For each model, I will use as dependent variable labor formality and as explanatory variables the rest of 13 demographic and labor market variables mentioned previously: 1. zone, 2. gender, 3. age, 4. race, 5. \# family members, 6. labor category, 7. labor branch, 8. working hours, 9. labor income, 10. job tenure, 11. firm size, 12. years of education and 13. poverty.

### Logistic regression

Logistic regression or logit is one of the traditional econometric techniques for modeling binary variables and seems a good starting point for analyzing the factors that explain labor informality in Bolivia. The logit specification traditionally follows this structure:

$$
Pr(Y=1 \mid X=x)
$$

In this case, we define outcome variable $Y$ as 1 for formal workers and 0 otherwise, and $X$ as a matrix of our reminding 13 explanatory variables. This methodology must be slightly adjusted at the time of making the forecasts, since they are not produced in a dichotomous way (0 or 1) but as continuous values that are between these limits, so they must be slightly corrected so that forecasts greater than 0.5 are equal to 1 and those less than 0.5 equal to 0.

The R command used for estimating this first approach is:

```{r Logistic Regression, echo=T, results='hide'}
glm_model <-  glm(formality ~ ., data= train_set, family = "binomial")
```

We will see the accuracy and the main variables coefficients (size and significance) in more detail in the Results section.

# Conclusion

Brief summary of the report, its potential impact, its limitations, and future work.

Los tres modelos tienen buena precisión de pronóstico y en los tres casos vemos que las 3 principales variables que estarían explicando la informalidad laboral son el tamaño de la empresa, el ingreso laboral y la categoria laboral.

-   5 points for 3 files

-   25 points a good report

-   20 points good R code script

-   try to send it January 3rd

As a next step I would like to distinguish informal workers between those who have voluntarily chosen to be part of this sector and those who are informal out of necessity, in this sense I think that in order to make this distinction it will be key to distinguish the monetary income of each sector, hoping that the voluntary informals earn much more money than the informals out of necessity, another group of variables could also help to make this distinction, perhaps elements such as the characteristics of the housing, the assets they possess or the degree of education of the workers could be variables that would allow for a relatively precise classification of both sectors. In this way, appropriate policies could be designed to advance the labor formalization of these people; it is very likely that the measures required to formalize some are not necessarily the same as those leading to the formalization of the others.
