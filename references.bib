  abstract={The purpose of this document is twofold. First, it seeks to explore some basic facts about workers’ formality status mobility in Bolivia in 2016 and 2017. Then, regressions are estimated to find hints about the factors that determine who moves, with a special focus on the role of international trade. Employer-provided health access and the level of education of the worker seem to be the strongest determinants of formality status transitions. International trade exposure is associated with labor informality, but the results suggest that it does not directly determine decisions to move from formality to informality or vice versa.},
